# ðŸ“Š Streamlit Stats Lab

Welcome to my interactive playground for learning and applying statistics using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), data visualization, and core Python tools like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

This repository documents my journey through:
- Building interactive apps with Streamlit
- Exploring statistical concepts and data analysis
- Developing visualizations and dashboards
- Practicing code organization for future projects

---

## ðŸš€ Goals

- âœ… Reinforce statistical thinking through hands-on projects
- âœ… Practice Python libraries for data analysis and visualization
- âœ… Build small, modular Streamlit apps as a future portfolio base
- âœ… Create reusable code patterns for future dashboards
